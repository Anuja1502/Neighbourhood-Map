Neighbourhood-Map(React)

This app consists of a list of suggestions in my hometown of Gurgaon, India. You can view information about any of the locations by clicking on the info windows. You can also search through the suggestions.

To run this project, download all the files to your system, run ‘npm install’ and then ‘npm start’ on your command prompt. 

• I have used parts of code from the Udacity lesson on Google maps and React
